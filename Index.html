        <h1>How does relying on AI for Content Creation and Curation impact users' ability to access information and seek diverse sources?</h1>

        <p>
        The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has dramatically transformed the media industry, particularly in how it influences the content we consume daily, from the articles we read to the movies we watch. As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, it increasingly affects how we live, making many features and sources more convenient and accessible. This essay will focus on the impact of AI on content creation and curation, specifically examining how it shapes our ability to access and critically assess information. Key topics will include the authenticity of AI-generated content, the consequences of overdependence on AI, and how AI's role in media has evolved over the years.

    <h4>Collection of Data</h4>
       <p>
        A lot of the content we see nowadays is personalised to us, whether it may be an Instagram post or an ad pop-up. People may have realised that a lot of the ad pop-ups they seen have been something they’ve had a recent interest in or have been talking about. With the use of AI, all our search engines know what we’ve had a sudden interest in as they collect all the data and from this, they personalise our feed as well as the ads we always see. As well as personalising content, AI also shows us our content based on previous data patterns. This means that depending on the posts/content we see daily, this is analysed and our feed bases future content on this. This has its own pros and cons, it prioritises the content most watched and liked, continuing to show us more like this. However, this can limit people’s knowledge and broader understanding of what else there is on social medias, the internet. This is known as the ‘echo chamber effect’, where discussions, opinions, certain content etc is echoed back (selective exposure) to viewers constantly which therefore distorts other viewpoints as if they don’t exist. (Dhulipala, 2023) Some may appreciate how using AI, we can automictically generate captions on videos which can save a lot of time as humans won’t have to watch through the whole video and write these captions by hand. This is also great for when people are not able to listen to a video, they can read the captions and still feel like they can understand the video not feeling the need to skip or scroll past it.

   <h4>Performance</h4>
        <p>
        The use of AI has become a necessity for content creation, especially for brands who have many competitors and need to always keep on top of their toes. ‘Research shows that 58% of marketers who use generative AI report increased content performance. 54% see cost savings.’ (Thomson, 2024) With the help of AI Content creators/Curators can generate content faster and of much better quality to a certain extent, all while personalising it to the viewers needs and interests. ‘AI can significantly improve the efficiency of content creation. With AI-powered tools, writers can generate high-quality content at a faster rate.’ (Tumas, 2024) This is because it’s consistency and speed it is quick and easy saving a lot of time. Effective GTM (Go-To-Market) strategies are crucial but to make sure they are targeted to the right audience and of high quality, this can take a good deal of time and slow down the process which large companies cannot afford. (Thomson, 2024) This leaves them with GTM bloat (inefficiency and hindering the process). (Coleman, 2024) Integrating AI into this increases productivity and improves the quality of content. With the help of tailor-made content, this reaches the right audience and makes the campaign more engaging and impactful.

    <h4>User Engagement and Attention Spans</h4>
        <p>
        AI can be used to maximize user engagement and a great way this is achieved is by leaving the viewer curious, excited, frustrated, even angry at times. This is all so that people continue to watch and share content to their friends and family. As this affects them emotionally, this also grabs their attention increasing the users time spent on social medias and the internet. An example of this is TikTok, the ‘infinite scroll’ feature ensures that people continue to watch for long periods of time. However, people with shorter attention spans will scroll through content faster exposing themselves to more information meaning they won’t be engaging as well as creators would like. This is why they prefer photos and shorter videos, so they are continuously scrolling. (Freedom, 2023) Many platforms as well as TikTok such as Instagram reels, Snapchat spotlight and YouTube shorts all have similar features and viewers can continue scrolling which seems to be never ending. It has specifically been designed so that there is something new to watch every time so that people keep scrolling. And these are all connected to the previous content that has been played, affecting future content.

    <h4>An Asset or a Threat?</h4>
        <p>
        When AI had newly been introduced in the industry, it wasn’t seen as an asset but a threat. (Marr, 2020) Many people thought they would lose their jobs, and this would largely impact the industry job market. As it was said to do everything from creating images, ideas, research and writing, employees began to get concerned about this and what the outcome of this would be. “I’m amazed at how quickly ChatGPT has become so sophisticated. Give it a few more years, and I can absolutely imagine a world in which a bot does my job just as well as I can.” (Cox, 2023) At times there was doubt in the originality and authenticity of work created by AI. Although its work is very creative and cost effective, there was always a lack of the human touch and emotion behind its work making it difficult to completely accept and use AI tools. Without this emotion, viewers and consumers cannot make an emotional connection with the piece of work and see its true value. Overtime, AI has made its own place in the industry and is used by most companies big or small. They now are not seen as much of a threat, but people choose to use this to complete their day-to-day projects and feel more at ease. It is mainly used for idea generation, creating storylines, experimenting and storytelling.

    <h4>Death of the Author</h4>
        <p>
        ‘AI-powered chatbots are not only exploiting human creativity but rapidly eroding it’ (Huang, 2023) ChatGPT takes text and information from all over the internet, it then uses all this information separating them from their sources and authors. This may encourage more people to use ChatGPT for their work rather than researching on their own. Other writers may feel the same or even choose not to publish with the thought of ChatGPT accessing it. Whatever they generate, is never sourced and we can never know whether this information is true or made up as not many people cross check the information. ‘The programming web forum StackOverflow banned ChatGPT generated answers in 2022, – shortly after the chatbot was released – saying that its answers are often simultaneously incorrect and plausible, making them difficult to moderate.’ (Huang, 2023) The authors are also never credited for the writing they have produced or the findings they have shared such as a naming the author or a linking the website it was found. Most importantly, authors won’t have control of this work once it’s been published, the audience will decide what this means and of how their work is used.

        Overall, the reliance on AI has transformed massively over the years, from believing it was going to take over our jobs to now working alongside it to complete day to day tasks. It is a great platform to access information quite easily as it will give us exactly what we ask for. AI helps in completing more takes in less time, proving to be cost efficient as well as of high quality. This means more content can be produced and posted keeping the viewers interested and engaged which is great for brand image. However, over reliance of AI would mean being stuck with one style and perspective, not branching out to other possibilities and opinions. There is a thin line between AI generated content and authentic content which has been researched, sourced and written about. This can be difficult to differentiate, and it is crucial when using such software’s to make sure what we’re reading and seeing is original and can be trusted and authors are credited for work they have produced.
